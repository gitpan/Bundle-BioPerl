This is not a module that people generally need to download
and install locally. This Bundle is meant to live on CPAN so
that people can use CPAN.pm magic to automagically download and
install modules.

The syntax for doing this would be something like:
$ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::BioPerl'

However if you really want to...

To install this Bundle file locally:

perl Makefile.PL
make install

Then, for a full list of the modules which this bundle
installs, use:

perldoc Bundle::BioPerl

Finally, to install the modules which the bundle lists:

perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::BioPerl'

This bundle gathers together all of the CPAN hosted external
modules for BioPerl.
